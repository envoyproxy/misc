# misc

This repository serves miscellaneous downloads for the [Envoy®](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) project.

Unlike usual repositories, a [release](https://github.com/envoyproxy/misc/releases) here is a
download category. This means releases are unrelated to each other. Rather, they are a bundle of
related artifacts.

For example, a release named "jaegertracing-plugin" would have nothing to do with other releases,
except that these are for Envoy purposes, most typically download links in examples or blogs.

This is not an appropriate place to serve production artifacts or sub-projects. This repository is
to provide an alternative to checking in miscellaneous binaries into source control or relying on
third-party sites.
